- **Content**:  
  - Explain the prevalence of misleading science articles and their impact.  
  - Introduce RAG as a solution for retrieving and generating accurate summaries.  
  - Share an overview of the project:  
    - NLP for understanding studies.
    - Speedy search with FAISS.
    - Persistent storage with MongoDB.
  - Walk through how the tool will work (chat feature, submission forms, misinformation detection).
  - Set up the project folder structure.  

- **Milestone**: Reader creates a new project folder and initializes it with `README.md`, feeling excited about starting something meaningful.

#### **Part 2: Setting Up Your Backend with Python and FastAPI**  
- **Title**: *Building the Brains of Your RAG Tool with Python*  
- **Goal**: Introduce FastAPI and build a simple backend to handle user requests.  
- **Content**:  
  - Why Python and FastAPI are great for beginners:
    - Easy to learn.
    - Fast execution and minimal boilerplate.
  - Install Python, FastAPI, and Uvicorn.  
  - Build a "Hello, World" API endpoint.  
  - Explain API basics: endpoints, routes, and responses.  

- **Milestone**: Reader runs a local FastAPI server and shares the "Hello, World" API link with friends.  

---

#### **Part 3: Adding Speed with FAISS**  
- **Title**: *Supercharging Search with FAISS*  
- **Goal**: Teach readers how FAISS speeds up data retrieval and integrate it with the backend.  
- **Content**:  
  - Explain what FAISS does (fast similarity search for embeddings).  
  - Install FAISS and set up a basic vector store.  
  - Walk through embedding a few sample sentences using Hugging Face models.  
  - Query the FAISS index to find similar content.  

- **Milestone**: Reader runs a script that searches for the most relevant chunk of text from their sample embeddings, demonstrating the power of FAISS.

#### **Part 4: Using Hugging Face SciBERT to Understand Scientific Text**  
- **Title**: *Teaching Your Tool to Speak Science with Hugging Face*  
- **Goal**: Show readers how to integrate SciBERT for embedding scientific text.  
- **Content**:  
  - Introduction to Hugging Face and why SciBERT is perfect for scientific text.  
  - Install Hugging Face Transformers library.  
  - Load SciBERT and generate embeddings for sample scientific studies.  
  - Replace dummy embeddings in the FAISS index with real embeddings from SciBERT.  

- **Milestone**: Reader generates embeddings for real scientific studies, adding them to the FAISS index.

#### **Part 5: Storing and Indexing Metadata with MongoDB**  
- **Title**: *Keeping Track of the Details with MongoDB*  
- **Goal**: Teach readers how to store metadata and manage persistence.  
- **Content**:  
  - Introduction to MongoDB and its benefits for beginners:  
    - Free tier available.  
    - Simple to set up and use.  
  - Install MongoDB and set up a local database.  
  - Design a schema for storing study metadata (e.g., title, topic, discipline).  
  - Write Python code to store and query metadata.  

- **Milestone**: Reader saves metadata to MongoDB and retrieves it with a Python script.  

---

#### **Part 6: Building a Chat Feature to Debunk Clickbait**  
- **Title**: *Creating Conversations with Your RAG Tool*  
- **Goal**: Build a simple chat feature to engage users.  
- **Content**:  
  - Introduce the concept of RAG-based chat.  
  - Use FastAPI to create an endpoint that:  
    - Accepts user questions.  
    - Queries FAISS for relevant study chunks.  
    - Returns summarized responses using Hugging Face models.  
  - Test the endpoint with simple user questions.  

- **Milestone**: Reader interacts with their RAG tool via the chat feature.  

---

#### **Part 7: Designing a Frontend with Next.js**  
- **Title**: *Making Your Tool Look Good with Next.js*  
- **Goal**: Introduce Next.js and create a user-friendly frontend.  
- **Content**:  
  - Why Next.js is great for this project (SEO, server-side rendering).  
  - Set up a Next.js app and deploy a basic homepage.  
  - Build a chat interface to connect with the FastAPI backend.  

- **Milestone**: Reader types questions into the frontend and sees responses from the RAG tool.  

---

#### **Part 8: Adding Features for User Contributions**  
- **Title**: *Inviting Users to Join the Science Conversation*  
- **Goal**: Add forms for users to submit articles, studies, and requests.  
- **Content**:  
  - Create forms for user submissions.  
  - Add user invitation functionality with admin approval.  
  - Save form data to MongoDB and process it with FastAPI.  

- **Milestone**: Reader submits a study or article through the frontend and sees it stored in MongoDB.  

---

#### **Part 9: Deploying Your Tool for Free**  
- **Title**: *Taking Your RAG Tool Live*  
- **Goal**: Deploy both frontend and backend to free hosting platforms.  
- **Content**:  
  - Deploy Next.js frontend to **Vercel**.  
  - Deploy FastAPI backend to **Render** or **Fly.io**.  
  - Test the deployed tool end-to-end.  

- **Milestone**: Reader shares their live tool with friends and family.
