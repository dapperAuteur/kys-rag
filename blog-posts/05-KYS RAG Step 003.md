### **Step 3: Adding Memory to Your Science Decoder Tool**

#### **Quick Recap of Step 2**
In Step 2, we built the "brain" of our Science Decoder Tool. We used FastAPI to create a web service that can answer science questions. The tool uses SciBERT (a special AI model) to understand scientific text, and FAISS to search through information quickly. We tested it by asking questions and got answers back!

Now, we need to give our tool a way to remember information even after we turn it off. Think of it like giving your tool a notebook to write things down, instead of trying to keep everything in its head.

### **What We'll Build in Step 3**
1. Connect to a database (MongoDB) that can store information forever
2. Create a way to save scientific studies
3. Make it easy to find studies later
4. Add backup plans in case things go wrong

---

### **Why This Matters**
Right now, when you stop your tool, it forgets everything. That's like closing a book and having all the words disappear! By adding MongoDB, your tool can keep information safe and find it again later, just like having a library of books you can always come back to.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 3.1: Set Up Your Project**

1. First, install the tools we need:
```bash
pip install pymongo python-dotenv
```

2. Create a new file called `.env` in your project folder and add these lines:
```
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/
MONGODB_LOCAL_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
```

3. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` with your MongoDB Atlas information. Don't have MongoDB Atlas? You can:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new cluster
   - Get your connection string from the "Connect" button

#### **Step 3.2: Update Your Code**

Save the following code as `main.py`. This adds all the new features we need:

#### **Step 3.3: Test Everything**

Let's make sure everything works! Open your terminal and follow these steps:

1. **Start your server**:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. **Test saving a study**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/save-study" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "The Effects of Climate Change",
    "text": "This study discusses the impact of rising temperatures on ecosystems.",
    "topic": "Environment",
    "discipline": "Ecology"
  }'
```

You should see something like:
```json
{"message": "Study saved successfully", "id": "12345..."}
```

3. **Find studies about the environment**:
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/get-studies/Environment"
```

You should see the study you just saved:
```json
{
  "studies": [
    {
      "_id": "12345...",
      "title": "The Effects of Climate Change",
      "text": "This study discusses the impact of rising temperatures on ecosystems.",
      "topic": "Environment",
      "discipline": "Ecology"
    }
  ]
}
```

If something goes wrong, check:
- Is your MongoDB connection string correct in the `.env` file?
- Did you install all the required packages?
- Is your server running?

### **What Makes This Approach Great**
- **Always Safe**: Your data stays safe, even if your computer restarts
- **Grows With You**: MongoDB can handle lots of information as your needs grow
- **Backup Plan**: If the cloud database (Atlas) isn't available, it automatically uses a local backup

### **Things to Watch Out For**
- Make sure to keep your MongoDB Atlas username and password secret
- Test both saving and finding studies to make sure everything works
- Start with the free tier of MongoDB Atlas - you can upgrade later if needed

---

### **What's Next?**
In Step 4, we'll make your tool even smarter! We'll combine MongoDB with FAISS to create a super-powered search system. This means your tool will not only remember studies but also understand how they relate to each other. It's like giving your tool the ability to connect dots between different pieces of information!

Stay tuned for more exciting features! If you need help, remember you can always:
- Check the MongoDB Atlas documentation
- Look at the FastAPI guides
- Ask questions in the MongoDB community forums
