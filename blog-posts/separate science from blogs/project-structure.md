# Understanding Our Science Article Checker

This document explains how our project is organized and how information flows through it. Think of it like a map showing how everything works together to help people understand science articles better.

## Project Organization

Our project is organized like a well-planned library, with different sections for different types of information and tools. Here's what each folder does:

### Main Folders

## How Information Flows Through Our System

Let's walk through how our system works, using everyday examples to explain each part.

### When Someone Submits a Science Article

Imagine you're sending a letter through the post office. Here's how our system handles article submissions:

1. **Front Door (API Endpoint)**
   - User clicks "Submit Article" on the website
   - Like dropping a letter in a mailbox, the article goes to our system
   - The system gives them a tracking number (request ID)

2. **Sorting Office (Backend Processing)**
   - Just like postal workers sort mail, our system:
     - Checks if the article is complete
     - Looks for the scientific studies it mentions
     - Saves everything in the right place

3. **Filing Cabinet (Database)**
   - Articles and studies are stored like files in a cabinet
   - Each gets a special label (metadata) to find it later
   - Everything is organized by topic and date

### When Someone Asks a Question

Think of this like asking a librarian for help:

1. **Question Desk (Chat Interface)**
   - User types their question
   - System acknowledges they're asking for help

2. **Research Process (RAG System)**
   - Like a smart librarian, the system:
     - Searches through stored articles and studies
     - Finds the most relevant information
     - Double-checks facts against scientific studies

3. **Answer Delivery (Response Generation)**
   - Combines all the found information
   - Explains everything in simple terms
   - Provides links to original sources

## Special Features

### Vector Search (Our Smart Card Catalog)
Instead of just looking for exact matches, our system understands the meaning of questions and finds related information - like a librarian who knows that "heart health" articles might be relevant when someone asks about exercise.

### Fact Checking (Our Truth Detective)
The system compares what articles claim with what the scientific studies actually say - like having a fact-checker who reads both the headline and the full research paper.

### User Feedback Loop (Our Improvement System)
Users can tell us if answers were helpful, just like leaving a review at a store. This helps us make the system better over time.

## Making It All Work Together

Our code is organized to be:
- Easy to update (like having organized desk drawers)
- Quick to fix if something breaks (like having a toolbox where everything has its place)
- Simple to understand (like having clear labels on everything)

## For Business Decision Makers

This project demonstrates:
1. Modern AI technology use in practical applications
2. Attention to user experience and accessibility
3. Scalable architecture that can grow with your needs
4. Strong focus on accuracy and fact-checking
5. Community-driven improvements

## Next Steps

Want to try it out? You can:
1. Visit our demo site
2. Submit an article for analysis
3. Ask questions about scientific studies
4. Provide feedback to help us improve
