error message:

A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.2.1 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2

proposed solution:

pip install "numpy<2.0"

fastapi
numpy<2.0
torch
transformers

pip install -r requirements.txt

thank you. I ran this curl command on the server file I shared earlier and 

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"How long does the Earth take to orbit the Sun?", "context":"The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes approximately 365.25 days to complete one orbit."}'
got this response:


{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["query","question"],"msg":"Field required","input":null},{"type":"missing","loc":["query","context"],"msg":"Field required","input":null}]}%
why did that happen and how do I fix it?

The error is occurring because the FastAPI route in your original code is expecting query parameters (using the route parameters directly), but you're sending the data as a JSON body in your curl request. Let's fix this by updating the route definition.

Here's how to fix your existing `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
from pydantic import BaseModel  # Add this import

# Create a request model
class QuestionRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str
    context: str

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the KYS RAG: Science Decoder Tool!"}

# Update the route to use the request model
@app.post("/ask")
def answer_question(request: QuestionRequest):  # Changed parameter
    inputs = tokenizer(request.question, request.context, return_tensors="pt")  # Use request.question and request.context
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    answer_start = outputs.start_logits.argmax()
    answer_end = outputs.end_logits.argmax() + 1
    answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(
        tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs.input_ids[0][answer_start:answer_end])
    )
    return {"answer": answer}
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a Pydantic model to validate the request body
2. Updated the route to accept the request body instead of query parameters

Your curl command is correct and should now work with this updated code. If you're still having issues, you can also try the curl command with verbose output to see more details:

```bash
curl -v -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"How long does the Earth take to orbit the Sun?", "context":"The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes approximately 365.25 days to complete one orbit."}'
```

If you're still having trouble after making these changes, please let me know and I can help troubleshoot further.

the response I got is: {"answer":""}%. I was expecting {"answer":"365.25 days"}

response:

This is likely happening because the model's token predictions (answer_start and answer_end) aren't correctly identifying the answer span in the text. Let's modify the code to handle this better and add some debugging to see what's happening:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
from pydantic import BaseModel
import torch  # Add this import

class QuestionRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str
    context: str

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the KYS RAG: Science Decoder Tool!"}

@app.post("/ask")
def answer_question(request: QuestionRequest):
    # Tokenize input
    inputs = tokenizer(request.question, request.context, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
    
    # Get model outputs
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    
    # Find the tokens with the highest probability of being start and end
    start_scores = outputs.start_logits
    end_scores = outputs.end_logits
    
    # Get the most likely start and end positions
    start_index = torch.argmax(start_scores)
    end_index = torch.argmax(end_scores)
    
    # Make sure end_index is after start_index
    if end_index < start_index:
        end_index = start_index + 1
    
    # Convert indices to actual text
    all_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs.input_ids[0])
    answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(all_tokens[start_index:end_index + 1])
    
    # Clean up the answer
    answer = answer.strip()
    
    # If answer is empty, return a message
    if not answer:
        return {"answer": "Could not find answer in context", "debug_info": {
            "start_index": start_index.item(),
            "end_index": end_index.item(),
            "total_tokens": len(all_tokens)
        }}
    
    return {"answer": answer}
```

I've made several improvements:
1. Added proper token index handling
2. Added truncation to prevent sequences that are too long
3. Ensured the end index comes after the start index
4. Added debugging information when no answer is found

Let's also try using a different model that might be better suited for this task:

```python
# Replace the model initialization with:
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")
```

This model is specifically trained for question answering on the SQuAD dataset and might give better results.

Try running your curl command again with either version. If you're still not getting the expected answer, could you share the debug_info that gets returned? This will help us understand where exactly the model is looking for the answer in the text.

Also, just to confirm - are you using exactly the same question and context as in your curl command? Sometimes small changes in wording can affect the model's ability to find the answer.

I added some more features to the server and uploaded the latest version. It's not working as expected. This is the servers response when I started it with the new code:

Some weights of BertForQuestionAnswering were not initialized from the model checkpoint at allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased and are newly initialized: ['qa_outputs.bias', 'qa_outputs.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

The error is occurring because of incorrect usage of NumPy's random function. There are a couple of issues in your code:

1. The main error is in this line:
```python
data = np.random((10, 768)).astype("float32")
```
Should be:
```python
data = np.random.random((10, 768)).astype("float32")
```

2. Also, you should ensure imports are consistent. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import faiss
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
from pydantic import BaseModel
import torch

class QuestionRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str
    context: str

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased")

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)

# Generate random embeddings for testing
data = np.random.random((10, 768)).astype("float32")
index.add(data)

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/search")
def search_vectors(query_vector: list):
    query = np.array([query_vector]).astype("float32")
    distances, indices = index.search(query, k=5)
    return {"distances": distances.tolist(), "indices": indices.tolist()}

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the KYS RAG: Science Decoder Tool!"}

@app.post("/ask")
def answer_question(request: QuestionRequest):
    inputs = tokenizer(request.question, request.context, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    
    start_scores = outputs.start_logits
    end_scores = outputs.end_logits
    
    start_index = torch.argmax(start_scores)
    end_index = torch.argmax(end_scores)
    
    if end_index < start_index:
        end_index = start_index + 1
    
    all_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs.input_ids[0])
    answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(all_tokens[start_index:end_index + 1])
    
    answer = answer.strip()
    
    if not answer:
        return {"answer": "Could not find answer in context", "debug_info": {
            "start_index": start_index.item(),
            "end_index": end_index.item(),
            "total_tokens": len(all_tokens)
        }}
    
    return {"answer": answer}

@app.get("/test-search")
def test_search():
    query_vector = np.random.random(768).astype("float32")
    distances, indices = index.search(np.array([query_vector]), k=3)
    return {"query": query_vector.tolist(), "distances": distances.tolist(), "indices": indices.tolist()}
```

The warning message about weights not being initialized is expected - it's just informing you that some layers of the model were initialized with random weights because they weren't present in the pretrained model. This shouldn't affect the question-answering functionality that was working before.

Try running this updated code. The server should start properly now. You can test it with the `/test-search` endpoint to make sure the vector search is working:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-search
```

Let me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues!
