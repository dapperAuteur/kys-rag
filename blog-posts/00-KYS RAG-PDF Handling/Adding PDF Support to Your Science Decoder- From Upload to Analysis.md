## Code Examples

Let's start with Step 1. Here's a basic PDF processor:

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader
import pdfplumber
import logging

class PDFProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    async def extract_text(self, file_path: str) -> str:
        """Extract text from PDF file."""
        try:
            text = ""
            with pdfplumber.open(file_path) as pdf:
                for page in pdf.pages:
                    text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
            return text
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error extracting text: {e}")
            raise

    async def get_metadata(self, file_path: str) -> dict:
        """Extract PDF metadata."""
        try:
            reader = PdfReader(file_path)
            return reader.metadata
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error extracting metadata: {e}")
            raise
```
